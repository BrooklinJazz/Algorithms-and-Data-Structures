# Building Abstractions with procedures.
3 acts of the mind
    - complex ideas: compounding many into one
    - relations: setting two ideas and setting them separately aside eachother
    - abstraction: separating them from all other concepts that accompany them in their real existence

code is like magic and sorcery

Lisp - John McCarthy late 1950s base on his paper "Recursive Functions of their symbolic representation and their computation by machine"

## Elements of Programming

• primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities the
language is concerned with,
• means of combination, by which compound elements are built
from simpler ones, and
• means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named
and manipulated as units.
