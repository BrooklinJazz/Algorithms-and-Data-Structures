# Overview and Introduction to Lisp
## What is Computer Science	
- computer science is not about computers nor is it a science
- coding and magic have more in common
- cs is actually about "process"
- declarative vs imperative knowledge
- exploit the rules to be a master programmer
- in computer science we are in the business of formalizing imperative knowledge
- the only reason it's possible for us to work on large scale programs (that we cannot possibly fit in our head) is because there are techniques that allow us to

## Techniques for Controlling Complexity
- computer science deals with idealised components
- not a big difference between what you can build and what you can imagine
- the constraints composed in building large software systems are the limitations of our own minds


what are the techniques?
1. Abstraction "Black Box Abstraction"
- visuallizing input -> process -> output without going into the detail of process
